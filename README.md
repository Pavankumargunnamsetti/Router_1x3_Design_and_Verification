# Router_1x3_Design_and_Verification
Router 1x3 Design using Verilog and Verification using UVM <br>
Overview :-  <br>
This project showcases the design and verification of a Router 1x3, which is a fundamental component in digital communication systems. The router directs incoming data to one of the three output ports based on control signals. This repository includes both the design and a comprehensive verification environment to ensure the functionality and reliability of the router. <br>

Features :- <br>
1x3 Routing Capability: Routes incoming data to one of three output channels based on select signals.
Comprehensive Verification: A robust testbench is included to validate the router's behavior under various scenarios and conditions. <br>

Functional Overview :- <br>
The project is implemented using Verilog for the design and SystemVerilog for the verification environment. It utilizes standard verification methodologies (UVM) to ensure thorough testing and coverage of all functional aspects. <br>

Prerequisites :-  <br>
Verilog and SystemVerilog simulation tools.
Familiarity with UVM methodology is recommended for understanding the verification environment. <br>
